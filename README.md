# Book Recommender
## üìã Project Overiew
The Book Recommender System is a Flask-based web application that uses preprocessed datasets and Pickle-stored models to offer book recommendations. It features a Top 50 Books section based on ratings and reviews and a Book Recommendation System that suggests the top 4 books related to a user's input. The app leverages Flask for backend logic and HTML/CSS for a responsive, user-friendly interface.
## üìä Key Features
- Top 50 Books: Displays the most popular books based on user ratings and reviews, filtered to include only books with at least 250 ratings, sorted by average rating.
- Cosine Similarity-Based Book Recommendations: Utilizes the cosine_similarity function to find and recommend the top 4 books similar to a given input book based on their content and features.
- Efficient Data Management: The system uses pre-processed data and Pickle models to efficiently store and retrieve book information, including titles, authors, and cover images.
- Interactive UI: Offers an intuitive interface built with Flask, HTML, and CSS, allowing users to search for books and get recommendations instantly.
- Data Filtering and Sorting: Ensures only high-rated and popular books are shown in the Top 50 list, improving the relevance and quality of recommendations.
- Book Details: Each recommended book includes the title, author, and cover image, making the recommendations more engaging and informative.

## üìù Conclusion
This project showcases the implementation of a book recommendation system using machine learning techniques to suggest books based on user input. By utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Flask, the application efficiently serves real-time book recommendations. The recommendation engine uses cosine similarity to identify the top 5 books related to a given book, providing users with personalized suggestions. The project highlights the use of data processing, machine learning models, and web development, making it a valuable tool for book discovery platforms, libraries, and reading applications.
